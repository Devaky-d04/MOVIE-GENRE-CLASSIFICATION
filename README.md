# MOVIE-GENRE-CLASSIFICATION
The project focuses on classifying movies into multiple genres using plot summaries. The dataset includes movies with associated titles, plot overviews, and genres. Since each movie can belong to multiple genres, this is a multi-label classification problem, where the goal is to predict a set of labels for each movie.
